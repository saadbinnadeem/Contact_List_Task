A Flutter project to display contacts from the device with a custom search filter.

## Objective

This project demonstrates how to access mobile contacts, display them in a styled `ListView`, and apply a search filter to find contacts by name.

### Features:
- Request permission to access contacts.
- Fetch and display contacts with their name and phone number.
- Real-time search filter to find contacts by name.
- Custom styling of contact list items.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application that reads contacts from a device and displays them in a custom-designed list. A search bar is provided at the top to filter contacts based on their name.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. If you haven’t installed Flutter yet, follow the official installation guide:
- [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
